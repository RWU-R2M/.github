# Rover to Mars (R2M) at RWU :rocket::artificial_satellite:

## About Us

We are the *"Rover to Mars"* (R2M) university group from Ravensburg-Weingarten University (RWU) in Germany. Our team consists of Bachelor's and Master's students from various fields such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, management, media design, and social work.

Our mission is to build a Mars rover that combines complex mechanics and advanced software development. We aim to participate in the annual *"Canadian International Rover Challenge"* in Canada with our rover. In 2019, we made history by becoming the first team from Germany to participate in this international competition!

## Our Rover

Our rover is a testament to the interdisciplinary collaboration of our team members. It combines advanced mechanical engineering with sophisticated software development to tackle the challenges of extraterrestrial exploration.

## Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC)

The *CIRC* is an annual competition that simulates the challenges of establishing an early colony on an extraterrestrial planet. It encourages and rewards innovative and creative design, and provides a valuable addition to the education of anyone with an interest in science and technology.

## Upcoming Competition

We are planning to participate in the "CIRC 2024 Summer Competition" which will take place from August 9 to 12, 2024, in Alberta (Drumheller), Canada.
